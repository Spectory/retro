### About
Retro is a tool for retrospective meetings management.
It is a platform where your team can take notes, discuss, and post action items.
Every meeting is logged, so you can go back and review previews meetings.

Feel free to play around with the [Live demo](https://retro-demo.herokuapp.com/)
